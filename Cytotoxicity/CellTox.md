#### CellTox Green<sup>TM</sup> Assay in INS-1 832/13 Cells:

##### Materials needed: 

- A white or black 96-well plate
- CellTox Green kit
- Media **without** phenol red
- Sterile plastic boat
- multichannel pipette

------

1. Plate 100,000 cells/well in a 96 well plate using 100 to 200 µL of media (-phenol red). 

2. Wait 24 hours

3. Thaw CellTox Green components in 37 °C water bath, vortex, and then spin down

4. Map out your plate

5. Prepare CellTox Green components. Add 10 µL of CellTox Green dye to each 5 mL of clear RPMI

6. Make arsenic treatments out of that 5 mL

7. Treat cells with this solution.

NOTE: If limited supplies of dye, make however much dye/assay you need for wells and add 100 µL to each well, then make 2x treatment. Add 100 µL of this to the wells for endpoint of 1x treatment concentration.

8. Wait the appropriate amount of time, and measure absorbance according to assay directions. 
9. For a time-course, after measuring once, re-incubate cells, wait until additional time points are reached and re-measure absorbance.
