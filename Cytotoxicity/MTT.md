#### MTT Assay in INS-1 832/13 Cells:

##### Materials needed: 

- tissue culture treated 96-well plate
- a tissue culture treated 12-well plate
- Media **without** phenol red
- MTT
- DMSO

------

1. Expose INS-1 cells to iAs for 24 hours
2. Prepare 0.5 mg/ml MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide) in **complete** RPMI **without phenol red** to avoid phenol/MTT interferences. 
   -  This means RPMI with FBS, INS Supp., HEPES, etc. (Make < 50 mL)
3. Prepare As for dosing in MTT/RPMI medium
   - Control: MTT/RPMI medium used

4. Wash wells 1x with phenol red free RPMI
   - This can be plain RMPI as opposed to complete

5. Add 1 ml MTT/RPMI/Treatments onto wells and incubate in 37°C incubator for 1 hour

6. **Remove MTT/RPMI/Treatments.** 

7. Add 500 µl DMSO

   - Make sure that cells are lysed after waiting 15-30 minutes then mix thoroughly. 

   - Record absorbance then transfer to 96 well plate (100 µl in replicates)

8. Record absorbance at 570 nm w/ background correction (a well with DMSO and no cells on 96 well) at 630 nm

**Note: You should have at least two wells that do not contain cells but have had MTT/RPMI media and then DMSO as a control blank well**
