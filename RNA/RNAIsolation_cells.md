#### RNA Isolation - Cell Pellets:

##### Materials needed: 

- Norgen Total RNA Isolation Kit
- pelleted cells
- 100% Ethanol (EtOH)
- Microcentrifuge
- Vortexer

------

1. Add 350 µL of Buffer RL to cell pellet – let it sit for approximately 10 min

2. Lyse cells by vortexing for 15 seconds. Make sure everything is completely dissolved.

3. Add 200 µL of 96-100% EtOH, then mix by vortexing

4. Assemble the micro spin-column with the accompanying collection tube

5. Transfer the 600 µL of lysate + EtOH to the column and centrifuge for 1 min at 3500 x g (6000 RPM)

6. Discard flow through. Reassemble and repeat as necessary.

7. Add 400 µL of Wash Solution A to the column and centrifuge for 1 min at 14000 g (14000 RPM)

8. Discard flow-through. Reassemble. 

9. Repeat a second time. Then a third.

10. After the 3rd repeat, discard the flow-through and spin 2 min to dry.

11. Place the column into a fresh 1.7 mL elution tube

12. Add 30-50 µL of Elution Solution A to the column

13. Centrifuge for 2 min 200 x g (2000 RPM)

14. Centrifuge for 1 min 14000 x g (14000 RPM)

Nanodrop and calculate volume needed for the desired concentration of RNA per aliquot. Store aliquots in the -80 freezer.
