   immediately in real time reactions.

**Real Time** **PCR**

1. Prepare PCR master mix as follows:  

| Real  Time PCR Master Mix          |                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **reagent**                        | **µl per sample (20 uL total)** |
| nuclease free  H2O                 | 7.67                            |

2. Briefly vortex master mix and centrifuge.

3. Add 18.67 µl of master mix to each well.

4. Add RT product (1.33 µl per reaction) to each well.

5. . Seal the plate with optical adhesive cover.

6. Centrifuge plate briefly.

7. Run thermal cycler with following parameters:

·    Everything is stored in the 4°C 

- There are multiple boxes: Blue – DNA, Green – Small RNA, Green – RNA  **(Choose the correct one)**

Inside The Box:

 Blue lid – dye. Light sensitive. Needs aluminum around it.

Green lid- nano marker. Can stay on ice / with samples

Red lid – gel matrix 

·    Bring contents of box to RT, except for green lid nano marker

·    Thaw RNA samples on ice, aliquot 25 – 500 ng / µL per sample = ~3 or 4 µL /sample

\-     Turn on water bath 70°C

 

**Prep the Gel-Dye Mix**

·    Dye @ RT (blue lid). Vortex and spin down. 1 µL of dye into 65 µL of filtered gel aliquot. (might need to make filtered gel aliquots)

·    Vortex well and spin mix @ 13000 g for 10 minutes, RT

o  During this time:

§ Go get the ladder. It’s in the -80°C in a box marked Rowan aliquots (**make sure it’s denatured already if you haven’t done so!!!)**

§ Load chips w/ RNase Away / H2O ~400 µL (follow instructions on paper by machine)

§ On computer: Program- 2100 Expert, check to make sure correct machine (RNA). Assay -> RNA -> total RNA

·    Solution should be clear. Cover w/ foil. Keep at RT

·    Denature sample aliquots. 2 min @ 70°C then immediately on ice.

·    Remember to turn off the heating block when finished



·    Prep the stand. Syringe @ 1 mL, lever at the top 

·    Place chip on stand. Load 9 µL of gel-dye mix into dark G. Push down syringe slowly until it clicks. Wait 30 seconds. Release. Plunger should come up slowly. Pull it up to 1 mL when it’s done

·    Load 9 µL in other Gs. 

·    Load 5 µL green marker in all wells + ladder (NOT IN Gs)

·    Load 1 µL ladder in ladder well

·    Load 1 µL of each sample. Add 1 µL green marker in unused wells

·    Vortex plate 1 min. Put in the machine.
