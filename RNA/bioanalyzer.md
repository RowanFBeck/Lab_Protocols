##### Materials needed: 

- Isolated RNA (or DNA)
- A bioanalyzer

------

**This protocol uses the Agilent RNA Nano Bioanalyzer Kit**

------

**Setting up the Chip Priming Station**

1. Replace the syringe

- Unscrew the old syringe from the lid of the chip priming station

- Release the old syringe from the clip. Discard.

- Remove the plastic cap of the new syringe and insert it into the clip

- Slide it into the hole of the luer lock adapter. Screw tightly to priming station.

2. Adjust the base plate

- Open the chip priming station by pulling the latch

- Using a screwdriver, open the screw at the underside of the base plate

- Lift the base plate and insert it again in position C. Retighten the screw.

3. Adjust the syringe clip

- Release the lever of the clip and slide it up to the top position

**Preparing the RNA Ladder**

1. Spin the ladder down and pipette in an RNase free vial

2. Heat denature the ladder for 2 min at 70C

3. Immediately cool the vial on ice

4. Prepare aliquots in a recommended 0.5 mL RNase-free vials with required amount for typical daily use

5. Store aliquots at -70C. After initial heat denaturation, frozen aliquots should not require repeated heat denaturation

6. Before use, thaw ladder aliquots on ice (avoid extensive warming).

**Preparing the gel:**

1. Pipette 550 µL of RNA gel matrix (red) into a spin filter

2. Centrifuge at 1500g for 10 min at room temp.

3. Aliquot 65 µL filtered gel into 0.5 mL RNase-free microcentrifuge tubes. Use filtered gel within 4 weeks. Store at 4C.

**Preparing the Gel-Dye Mix**

1. Allow the RNA dye concentrate (blue) to equilibrate to room temp for 30 min

2. Vortex RNA dye concentrate (blue) for 10s, spin down and add 1 µL of dye into a 65 µL aliquot of filtered gel

3. Vortex solution well. Spin tube at 13000 g for 10 min at RT. Use prepared mix within one day.

**Loading the Gel-Dye Mix**

1. Put a new RNA chip on the chip priming station

2. Pipette 9 µL of gel-dye mix in the well marked G

3. Make sure that the plunger is positioned at 1 mL then close the chip priming station

4. Press plunger until it is held by the clip

5. Wait for exactly 30s then release clip

6. Wait for 5 s. Slowly pull back plunger to 1 mL position.

7. Open the chip priming station and pipette 9 µL of gel-dye mix in the wells marked G

8. Discard the remaining gel-dye mix (once experiment is done)

**Loading the Marker**

1. Pipette 5 µL of RNA marker (green) in all 12 sample wells and in the well marked (ladder)

**Loading the Ladder and Samples**

1. Pipette 1 µL of prepared ladder in well marked (ladder)

2. Pipette 1 µL of sample in each of the 12 sample wells

- Pipette 1 µL of RNA marker (green) in each unused sample well

3. Put the chip horizontally in the IKA vortexer and vortex for 1 min at 2400 RPM

4. Run the chip in the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer instrument within 5 min

·    Everything is stored in the 4°C 

- There are multiple boxes: Blue – DNA, Green – Small RNA, Green – RNA  **(Choose the correct one)**

Inside The Box:

 Blue lid – dye. Light sensitive. Needs aluminum around it.

Green lid- nano marker. Can stay on ice / with samples

Red lid – gel matrix 

·    Bring contents of box to RT, except for green lid nano marker

·    Thaw RNA samples on ice, aliquot 25 – 500 ng / µL per sample = ~3 or 4 µL /sample

\-     Turn on water bath 70°C

 

**Prep the Gel-Dye Mix**

·    Dye @ RT (blue lid). Vortex and spin down. 1 µL of dye into 65 µL of filtered gel aliquot. (might need to make filtered gel aliquots)

·    Vortex well and spin mix @ 13000 g for 10 minutes, RT

o  During this time:

§ Go get the ladder. It’s in the -80°C in a box marked Rowan aliquots (**make sure it’s denatured already if you haven’t done so!!!)**

§ Load chips w/ RNase Away / H2O ~400 µL (follow instructions on paper by machine)

§ On computer: Program- 2100 Expert, check to make sure correct machine (RNA). Assay -> RNA -> total RNA

·    Solution should be clear. Cover w/ foil. Keep at RT

·    Denature sample aliquots. 2 min @ 70°C then immediately on ice.

·    Remember to turn off the heating block when finished



·    Prep the stand. Syringe @ 1 mL, lever at the top 

·    Place chip on stand. Load 9 µL of gel-dye mix into dark G. Push down syringe slowly until it clicks. Wait 30 seconds. Release. Plunger should come up slowly. Pull it up to 1 mL when it’s done

·    Load 9 µL in other Gs. 

·    Load 5 µL green marker in all wells + ladder (NOT IN Gs)

·    Load 1 µL ladder in ladder well

·    Load 1 µL of each sample. Add 1 µL green marker in unused wells

·    Vortex plate 1 min. Put in the machine.
