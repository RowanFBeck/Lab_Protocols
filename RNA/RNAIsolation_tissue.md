1. ​    Excise the tissue sample 

   a.    Use a clean razor blade. Weigh out desired amount of tissue. Record weight. 

   ​		**Tissue      Max. Input Amount**
   ​		 Brain           25 mg
   ​		 Heart            5 mg
    		Kidney         10 mg
   ​		 Liver            10 mg
    		Lung            10 mg
    		Spleen         10 mg

   b.    Dispose of the razor blade in the sharps container of cell culture room

2. Clean the homogenizer 

   a.    Use three 15mL tubes: RNase Free H<sub>2</sub>O, RNase Away (pour from the bottle), RNase Free H<sub>2</sub>O

3. Pulverize tissue with the hammer. 

4. Transfer to a clean Eppendorf tube containing 600 µL of lysis buffer

5. Homogenize 

6. Centrifuge 2 minutes at 15000 RPM

7. Transfer the supernatant – be very careful to not suck up the pellet 

8. Add equal volume of 70% EtOH to the Eppendorf tube (~600 µL) and vortex to mix. 

9. Put through the column 600 µL each time. Don’t overload the column.

10. Spin 1 min at 14000 RPM, discard flow through. Repeat.

11. 400 µL of wash solution to column. Spin 1 min 14000 RPM.

12. Repeat step 10, twice more for a total of 3 washes. 

13. Spin 2 min at 14000 RPM to dry.

14. Elute in 50 µL of elution buffer

15. Spin 2 min at 2000 RPM

16. Spin 1 min at 14000 RPM

17. Nanodrop and store in -80°C
