##### Materials needed: 

- miRNAeasy Serum/Plasma RNA Isolation Kit by Qiagen
- Qiazol lysis reagent
- serum or plasma samples

------

**This protocol uses the miRNAeasy Serum/Plasma Kit made by Qiagen**

**This protocol has been modified to incorporate recommendations from the Vickers Lab, at Vanderbilt University**

------

1. Prepare serum / thaw frozen samples (Note, frozen plasma samples take a long time to thaw. Plan ahead)

2. In the fume hood, add 5x-10x volume of QIAzol Lysis Reagent to each sample (eg. For 100 µL add 500 µL - 1000 µL ). Mix by vortexing or pipetting up and down. (Add more Qiazol for lipid-rich samples)

3. Incubate the homogenate at room temperature (RT) for 5 min

4. <u>OPTIONAL:</u> Add 3.5 µL miRNeasy Serum/Plasma Spike-In Control (at 1.6 x 108 copies/ µL) 

5. Under the hood, add chloroform of 20% volume to the qiazol (eg. For 100 µL starting sample, add 100 µL). Cap tube securely and sake vigorously for 15 sec. 

6. Incubate at RT for 2-3 min

7. Centrifuge for 15 min at 12,000 x g (4 C)

8. Transfer the upper aqueous phase to new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. AVOID transferring any interphase. Add 1.5 volumes of 100% EtOH (eg for 600 µL aqueous phase, add 900 µL EtOH). Mix thoroughly by pipetting and freeze samples in -80 C two hours or longer. 

**NOTE: I stopped at this point, and left samples to freeze overnight**

9. Pipet up to 700 µL sample, including precipitates into an RNeasy MinElute spin column in a 2 mL collection tube. Close the lid and centrifuge at least 8000x g for 15 sec at RT. Discard flow through.

10. Repeat using remainder of sample.

11. Add 700 µL Buffer RWT to the RNeasy MinElute spin column. Close the lid, centrifuge for 15 s at 8000 x g. Discard flow-through. 

12. Pipet 500 µL Buffer RPE onto the RNeasy MinElute spin column. Close the lid and centrifuge for 15 s at 8000x g. Discard flow through.

13. Add 500 µL of 80% EtOH to the RNeasy MinElute spin column. Close the lid and centrifuge for 2 min at 8000x g. Discard flow-through and the collection tube. 

14. Place RNeasy MinElute spin column in a new 2 mL collection tube (supplied). Open the lid of the spin column and centrifuge at full speed for 5 min to dry the membrane. Discard flow-through and the collection tube. 

15. Place RNeasy MinElute spin column in a new 1.5 mL collection tube (supplied). Add 14 µL RNase-free water directly to the center of the spin column membrane. Close the lid gently, and centrifuge for 300 x g for 2 minutes, and then spin again at 10,000 x g for 2 minutes.
