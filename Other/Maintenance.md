#### Lab Maintenance:

------

**CELL CULTURE** 

1. Make 70% EtOH (carboy)

2. Check incubator – CO2 and H2O

3. Fill/autoclave glass Pasteur pipets

4. Check stock

- 75 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks

- 12 well tissue culture treated plates

- Components for making media

 

**RNA AREAS**

1. RNAse away benches, change bench paper weekly

2. Change RNAse free H2O aliquots

3. Clean pipetmen with RNAse away (as needed).

 

 

**General Maintenance**

1. Recycling

2. Autoclave biohazard bags

3. Dishes

 

**In general, please pay close attention to the following:**

1. Keep your computer desk area as clean as possible.

2. Clean up after yourself at the bench and in the TC room. (Empty waste beakers into trash, place bench top biohazard bags into large biohazard container, place empty plastics into recycling, clean/organize/prep bench for next person). Return equipment and reagents back to the place where you found them.

3. Put dirty dishes at the sinks to be washed.

4. Monitor items/reagents regularly used by the lab (i.e., pcr master mix, RT kits, DNAse kits, etc.); when certain items/reagents are **running low**, write them down somewhere and notify someone.

5. If you sign for a package, put temperature sensitive materials in the appropriate place.

6. Wear a lab coat when working at the bench.

7. If you are teaching someone from another lab protocols regularly used by our lab, and if they will be using our machines/reagent, please have them see Christelle for ‘lab orientation’ after you have taught them the protocol.

8. Please pay attention to kit protocols. (i.e., add EtOH to wash solution and make sure the bottle is marked).
