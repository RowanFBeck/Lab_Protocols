#### **Freezing Cells**:

##### Materials needed: 

- cultured cells 
- media
- PBS
- Trypsin
- tissue culture grade sterile dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)
- cryovials
- cell freezing chamber
-  -80°C freezer
- liquid N2 tank for long term storage



1. Create a freezing medium consisting of 90% culturing media + 10% DMSO
2. Remove cells from the dishes following the usual method for passaging. 
3. Pool all cells and centrifuge
4. After centrifugation, resuspend the cell pellet with freezing medium so that there are 2 million cells/ mL of freezing medium. 
5. Mix thoroughly then aliquot 1mL of frozen medium/cells per cryovial. 
6. Vials should be labeled for passage number and cell counts using an ethanol-proof marker. 
7. Freeze cells using a cell freezing chamber. Vials are placed in the chamber, isopropanol is added up to the line on the side, and the chambers are placed at -80°C for at least 4 hours before moving to liquid nitrogen.
