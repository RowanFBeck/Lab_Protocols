#### Transfections in INS-1 832/13 Cells:

##### Materials needed: 

- Cells that have been plated on a 12-well plate
- Culturing Media
- Lipofectamine 2000/3000
- Serum-free media
- 1.5 mL eppendorf tubes

------

Cells are maintained in culturing medium and plated 12-24 hours before transfection. After this time, at ~60-80% confluency, the cells are transfected with appropriate concentrations of 

- mimic (usually 10nM final concentration) 

- inhibitor (usually 10-100nM final concentration LNA) 

  or 

- siRNA (usually 100nM final concentration) 

Using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent, the protocol proceeds as follows:

1. In tube 1:  Mix the siRNA and the serum free media by gently pipetting up and down. 
2. In tube 2:  Mix the Lipofectamine 2000 and the serum free media by gently pipetting up and down. 
3. Incubate the tubes at room temperature for 5 minutes. 
4. Add tube 1 to tube 2, mix by pipetting and incubate at room temperature for 20 minutes.



##### For a 12-well Plate:

- For each well, add 800µl of complete media and 200µl of the transfection mixture. 

- Alternatively, add the appropriate amount of complete media plus transfection reaction (master mix) and aliquot 1 mL into each well.

  

I have done12-hour transfections with LNAs before isolating RNA from the cells, however incubation times may vary and range from 24 - 48 hours. For the 48 hour transfections, we do not usually change the media.
