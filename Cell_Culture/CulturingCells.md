2 mL 1 M HEPES (Cat. 25-060-01, 100 mL)

2 mL 100 U Pen/Step (Cat. 30-002-01, 100 mL)

4.4 mL 50x **INS-supplement******* 

Bring up to 200 mL RPMI 1640 medium (Cat. 11875-093, 500 mL)

<u>Kept in fridge, until ~30 min prior in 37C</u>



***INS-Supplement Recipes:** Mix/Dissolve reagents, filter sterilize (0.2 uM filter), store aliquots (~4.5 mL) at -20 C

50x INS-Supplement for media **without** glutamine:

- 100 ml 200 mM glutamine solution

- 100 mL 100 mM sodium pyruvate solution

- 35.1 uL 2-mercaptoethanol (standard 14.3 M)

  

50x INS-Supplement for media **with** glutamine (1640 RPMI):

- 100 mL 50 mM sodium pyruvate solution
- 17.1 uL 2-mercaptoethanol

##### **Sub-Culturing Procedure:**

###### (Volumes are for 75 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks)

1. Remove and discard culture medium

   - Tilt Carefully, only touch the side of the flask

2. Rinse cells (gently) briefly with 10 mL PBS **without** Ca<sup>2+</sup>and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, then aspirate

3. Add 1.5 mL of trypsin-EDTA solution to flask and observe cells until cell layer is dispersed (1-2 min). 

   - Should see cells sliding around 
   - During this time, loosen cap on media. 

4. Add 10 mL of culture medium to the flask and mix gently to disperse the cell sheets and neutralize the trypsin. Make sure to wash any remaining cells adhering to the flask.

5. Add culture medium/cells to a 15 mL falcon tube

6. Centrifuge at 1200 RPM for 5 minutes at 25Â°C

   - Should see pellet formation at the bottom

7. Aspirate media carefully as to not disturb the pellet

8. Re-suspend in fresh media (usually 3 - 5 mL) and mix thoroughly

9. Aliquot ~50 uL into an eppendorf tube

10. Take aliquot and very gently fill one chamber underneath the coverslip of a hemocytometer, allowing the cell suspension to be drawn out by capillary action.  

    **To calculate the number of cells in 1 mL:**

    - count one set of 16 squares (Figure 1)

    - Move the hemocytometer to the next set of 16 corner squares and carry on counting until all 4 sets of 16 corners are counted. 

    -  Take the average cell count from each of the sets of 16 corner squares. 

    - Multiply that average by 10,000 to 

    - Use formula C<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub> = C<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub>  to calculate desired concentration of cells

11. Place desired concentration of cells into a tissue culture plate or new 75 cm<sup>2</sup> flask



 **For 12-well plate:** 

1 million / (concentration) x 13 mL = ___ mL of cells/media (+ enough media to bring to 13 mL). Mix then aliquot 1 mL of this mixture into each well. Mix within each well again.

**For a 75 cm<sup>2</sup> flask:** Aliquot cell mixture containing  ~2 million cells into the flask. Add enough media to bring total volume up to 17 mL.
