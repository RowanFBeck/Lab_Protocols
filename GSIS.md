##### Glucose Solutions:

###### 100 mL 1x SAB 0 mM glucose, pH 7.2 – Make the appropriate volume needed fresh each time. Make ahead, store in 37 C

- 10 mL of 10x SAB
- 2 mL of 1 M HEPES
- 1 mL of 0.25 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>
- 0.560 of mL 35% BSA
- 2.860 mL of 7.5% NaHCO3­
- 83.580 mL of diH2O

###### 2.5 mM glucose SAB – use 15 mL tube, mix when making and right before using

- 10 µL of 45% glucose 
- 10 mL of SAB 1x 

###### 16.7 mM glucose SAB – use 15 mL tube, mix when making and before using

- 66.8 µL of 45% glucose 
- 10 mL of SAB 1x 

##### Make glucose solutions and warm in 37 C prior to starting

##### Procedure:

1. In a 12-well plate, plate cells at 1,000,000/mL well. Let cells sit overnight before beginning exposure. Ensure cells are >90% confluent before conducting experiment.

2. Carefully aspirate off media and wash cells with warmed 1 mL SAB/0 mM glucose buffer per well.

3. Add 1 mL 0 mM glucose SAB buffer and incubate at 37C for 1 hour.

4. Carefully aspirate 0 mM SAB (cells tend to lift!). Add 1 mL warm SAB/2.5 mM glucose solution. Place pipette tip of sides of well to ensure cells do not lift when adding solution. Incubate plate for 1 hour at 37C.

5. After 1 hour, put 500 uL of 2.5 mM glucose SAB media into an Eppendorf tube. Remove remaining media carefuly and replace with 1 mL 16.7 mM glucose SAB. Incubate for 2 hours at 37C.

6. After 2 hours, put 500 uL of 16.7 mM glucose SAB media into an Eppendorf tube. Remove remaining media. Media aliquots can be frozen at -20C in tubes or 96-well plate for later analysis. 

7. Lyse cells and [collect protein](https://github.com/RowanFBeck/Lab_Protocols/blob/master/Protein/RIPA.md) for protein determination.

   ###### Use 25x protease inhibitor. “Complete” tablet. 1 tablet/2 mL water

- Add 40 uL protease inhibitor to 960 uL lysis buffer (Ripa)
- Aspirate – doesn’t matter if cells dry out because we’re lysing anyway
- Rinse with 1 mL **cold** PBS (-CaCl, - MgCl) to remove media then aspirate
- Add 75 uL of lysis buffer, and place plate on ice for 15-30 min.
- Scrape up protein/media and put 500 uL into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. 

Dilute glucose stimulation media samples prior to [insulin ELISA](https://github.com/RowanFBeck/Lab_Protocols/blob/master/Protein/ELISA.md) analysis.
