#### Treating Cells With Arsenicals:

##### Materials needed: 

- sodium arsenite (iAs<sup>III</sup>): NaAsO<sub>2</sub> 100 mmol stock
- methylarsine oxide (MAs<sup>III</sup>): MeAsO / CH<sub>3</sub>AsO 100 mmol stock
- Iododimethylarsine (DMAs<sup>III</sup>): C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>AsI 100 mmol stock
- warm media
- plated cells

------

**All of the following stocks should be done on ice and in the hood whenever possible.**

**These materials are <u>toxic</u>. Wear a face mask, gloves, and a lab coat.**

------

1. Prepare media if necessary or warm media

**KEEP ALL MAs/DMAs ON ICE. PREPARE JUST PRIOR TO USE.** 

**iAs is more stable, will need to thaw since made in diH<sub>2</sub>O. Thaw then keep cold.** 

2. Prepare 1 mM solutions using 100 mM stock (mix each stock solution well)

   - 10 µL of 100 mM stock in 990 µL media = 1 mM solution

   - 10 µL of 1 mM solution in 90 µL media = **100 µM working stock**

3. Using the 100 µM stock, calculate how much is needed for each concentration and volume.

   - Example: For 0.2 µM MAs in 8 mLs (enough for 7-8 wells):

     - 100 x 10-6 M (V1) = **0.2** x 10-6 M (8000 µL)
     - (0.0000002 M / 0.000100 M) x 8000 µL = 16 µL

     -  **Use 16 µL of 100 µM MAs in 8 mL for 0.2 µM concentration**

4. Carefully aspirate the current cell culture medium and replace with the desired volume (1 mL for 12-well plates) of your arsenic-containing medium
5. Discard the 100 µM stock solutions and make fresh each time
