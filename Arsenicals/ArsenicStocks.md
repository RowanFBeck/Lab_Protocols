#### Making Arsenic Stock Solutions:

##### Materials needed: 

- sodium arsenite (iAs<sup>III</sup>): NaAsO<sub>2</sub>
- methylarsine oxide (MAs<sup>III</sup>): MeAsO / CH<sub>3</sub>AsO
- Iododimethylarsine (DMAs<sup>III</sup>): C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>AsI
- ice cold ethanol
- ice cold diH<sub>2</sub>O

**All of the following stocks should be done on ice and in the hood whenever possible.**

**These materials are <u>toxic</u>. Wear a face mask, gloves, and a lab coat.**

 **sodium arsenite (iAs<sup>III</sup>): NaAsO<sub>2</sub>**

Molecular weight: 129.91 g/mol

129.91 g / mol of iAs --> 130 g/mol   #rounding

130 mg / mmol                   

X 0.001 L                          # to get mL rather than L

X 100 mmol                       # final stock concentration

= **13 mg / 1 mL of ice cold diH2O for 100 mM stock**

 

100 mmol stock should be divided into 100-200 µL aliquots and stored in -80 (ideal) or -20 (stable)

Work with only one aliquot at a time, and limit freeze-thaws to ~3 before discarding (due to oxidation)

 **methylarsine oxide (MAs<sup>III</sup>): MeAsO / CH<sub>3</sub>AsO**

Powder

Molecular weight: 105.956 g/mol 

105.9 g / mol of MAs --> 106 g/mol   #rounding

106 mg / mmol                   

X 0.001 L                          # to get mL rather than L

X 100 mmol                       # final stock concentration

**= 10.6 mg / 1 mL of ice cold 100% EtOH for 100 mM stock**

 

100 mmol stock should be divided into 100-200 µL aliquots and stored in -80, and discarded after ~1 week

 **Iododimethylarsine (DMAs<sup>III</sup>): C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>AsI**

Liquid

Molecular weight: 231.896 g/mol 

**5.81 µL stock solution in 500 µL ice cold 100% EtOH for 100 mM stock**

100 mmol stock should be divided into 100-200 µL aliquots and stored in -80, and discarded after ~1 week
